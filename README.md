# Calling timeouts in the NBA

###### by ricardo zacarias

As I get up to snack after watching another delicious fried chicken ad, I started wondering about how much of my life was being wasted by timeouts in NBA games. 

> *In the National Basketball Association (NBA), teams are allowed seven timeouts, each of 1 minute, 15 seconds. There is no limit on substitutions. In overtime periods, each team is allowed two timeouts. A timeout can only be requested by a player in the game or the head coach, and only when the ball is dead or in control of the team making the request.*

I wanted to get an accurate number of how many are used during a season, but I quickly discovered that timeout stats are not very common in game box scores. Still curious, I found some play-by-play data available [here](https://eightthirtyfour.com/data) and decided to have a go at it myself.

I found **13,437** total timeouts during the 2018-19 regular season. 

**6,652** taken by the home team, and **6,785** by the visiting team.

Below you can see on hover how much time your favorite team has cost you in timeouts (if you watched all 82 games, of course).

The first thing I noticed was that teams displayed more variability in the use of timeouts than I had anticipated. Rockets fans profit most from Mike D'Antoni's notorious reluctance in stopping the game:

> "What am I gonna do, say 'Oh, let me take the ball out of James's hand, then take it out, call a timeout, put it back in their hands in the exact same spot they were?' We just go with it." D'Antoni said in an [interview](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/05/02/steve-kerr-gregg-popovich-mike-dantoni-brad-stevens-brett-brown-nba-coaches-playoffs-timeouts) with Sports Illustrated earlier this year. 

Interestingly, he used to be the assistant to 76ers coach Brett Brown who sits on the other end of the spectrum. In the same interview he mentions that he never challenged his previous boss about all the voluntary stoppages. "The biggest thing, I thought," he said, "was that it ate into my dinner time." I feel you Mike.

We all know the very end of close games can be quite painful thanks to TO calls, but I wondered how they are used during the rest of the game.
